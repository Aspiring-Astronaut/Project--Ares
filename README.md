# Project--Ares
**A Simulated Martian Plant Habitat**  
Designed and built by Madeline Symonds , Project ARES is a dual-chamber, 3D-printed environment that simulates Mars' extreme conditions while maintaining an Earth-like biosphere for plant growth experiments — specifically for radishes.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Project ARES (Agricultural Research in Extraterrestrial Simulation) is part of a student-led experiment for ISEF to test the feasibility of growing plants on Mars using a self-contained life support system.

---

## 🧪 Goals

- Simulate Mars external environment (low pressure, cold, high CO₂)
- Maintain Earth-like internal environment for plant growth
- Grow and track radish health and development
- Collect and analyze temperature, humidity, and growth data
- Propose a low-cost, scalable system for classroom Mars simulation

---

## 🛠️ Hardware

- Raspberry Pi (model 3B+) or Arduino
- DHT22 temp/humidity sensor
- Grow light (LED, 50 watts)
- Heater (20 watts)
- Humidifier (mini ultrasonic)
- 3D-printed enclosure (PLA, modular design)
- CO₂ simulation: [dry ice or other method]
- Camera (optional for growth tracking)

---
