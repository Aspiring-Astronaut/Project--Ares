### 🔧 Task(s) Completed:
- Finalized abstract and project hypothesis
- Outlined full environmental control system
- Created wiring plan and system diagram
- Defined component list and ordered Raspberry Pi + sensors

### 🧠 Thoughts:
Today I focused on clarifying my goals. The hardest part is going to be stabilizing humidity without causing mold or fog. I might use a small humidifier with an ultrasonic sensor and relay to cut it off at the ideal %RH.

### 🔍 Next Steps:
- Begin 3D printing base frame
- Test Pi + sensor readings
- Log environmental data to CSV file
