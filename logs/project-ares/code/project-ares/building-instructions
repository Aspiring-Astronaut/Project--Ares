# 🌱 Project ARES: Martian Plant Habitat Simulation

Welcome to Project ARES! This experiment simulates a harsh Martian environment on the outside, while maintaining Earth-like conditions inside a sealed terrarium to grow plants—starting with radishes.

## 🧩 Parts List

### 🖥 Electronics
- Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO & I²C)
- MicroSD card with Raspberry Pi OS
- SHT31-D Temperature & Humidity Sensor (I²C)
- Relay Module (1-channel)
- Heat lamp or 5V ceramic heater
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)

### 🌿 Enclosure
- 3D printed Mars shell (outer layer)
- 3D printed inner terrarium
- Clear plastic dome or jar (fits in shell)
- PLA filament (for printing)

### 💡 Other
- LED grow light (USB or 5V)
- Small radish seeds
- Potting soil
- Small humidifier or mister (optional, v2)
- Power supply for Pi and heat lamp

## 🛠️ Assembly Instructions

### 1. 🧠 Setup Raspberry Pi

- Flash Raspberry Pi OS to a microSD card
- Boot up and connect to Wi-Fi
- Enable I²C and GPIO via `raspi-config`

### 2. 🔌 Wire the Components

**SHT31-D Sensor (I²C):**
- VCC → 3.3V
- GND → GND
- SDA → GPIO 2
- SCL → GPIO 3

**Relay + Heat Lamp:**
- Relay IN → GPIO 17
- Relay VCC → 5V
- Relay GND → GND
- Plug heat lamp into relay output

### 3. 📦 Build the Habitat

- 3D print the shell and inner dome (see `enclosure/`)
- Place soil and radish seeds inside the inner terrarium
- Mount sensor inside dome
- Mount grow light above dome
- Make sure wires exit through a small opening in the shell

### 4. 💻 Install Software

Run this in the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-sht31d RPi.GPIO
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-ares.git
cd project-ares/code
python3 temp_control.py
